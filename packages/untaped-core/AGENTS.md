# AGENTS.md — `untaped-core`

Cross-cutting infrastructure: settings/profiles, http+TLS, config file,
output formatting, stdin helpers, errors. Owns the `Settings` schema —
new settings land here. For workspace-wide rules and the cross-cutting
helpers index, see the [root `AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md). For
user-facing config reference, see
[`docs/configuration.md`](../../docs/configuration.md).

## Settings schema (intentional inversion)

`untaped_core.settings` declares one `Settings` model with named
sub-models per domain (`AwxSettings`, `GithubSettings`,
`WorkspaceSettings`). This couples the "shared kit" to every domain by
name — deliberately. One schema in one place is what makes
`config_schema.walk_settings`, `untaped config list`, `redact_secrets`,
and env-var resolution work without a per-domain registration step.
Splitting the schema (one slice per domain plus a federation hook)
would solve a coupling that's tracked but not currently painful, at the
cost of breaking the introspection contract. When a 7th or 8th domain
lands and the coupling starts to feel real, reconsider; until then, new
settings go in an existing sub-model or a new sub-model here.

## Profile resolution (internals)

`~/.untaped/config.yml` is **profile-based**: every configurable value
lives under `profiles.<name>`, never at the top level. Two profile-related
keys live outside that block:

- `active: <name>` — selects which profile is active. May be unset (then
  `default` is used if it exists, otherwise no profile layer applies and
  values come straight from the schema). The `UNTAPED_PROFILE` env var or
  the root `untaped --profile <name>` flag override this for one process.
- `workspace.workspaces` — the workspace registry. **App state**, not
  user-tunable config; stays at the top level and is hoisted back into the
  merged dict by `ProfilesSettingsSource`.

Resolution order, high → low:

```text
env vars (UNTAPED_…)  >  active profile  >  default profile (optional)  >  schema default
```

The `default` profile is **optional**. Schema defaults
(`packages/untaped-core/src/untaped_core/settings.py`) are the implicit
floor for every profile. If `profiles.default` is present, it merges as a
shared overrides layer beneath the active profile.

The root `--profile` flag mutates `os.environ["UNTAPED_PROFILE"]` and
clears `get_settings`'s `lru_cache` immediately, so per-call overrides
take effect even when the cache was already populated.

User-facing semantics (writing, copying, deleting, renaming profiles)
live in [`docs/configuration.md`](../../docs/configuration.md#profiles).

## TLS verification

Defaults to the **OS trust store** via the `truststore` package — corporate
root CAs installed in macOS Keychain, Windows certstore, or the Linux
system trust just work. User overrides (`http.ca_bundle`,
`http.verify_ssl`) are documented in
[`docs/configuration.md`](../../docs/configuration.md).

**Implementation rule:** every domain client passes
`verify=resolve_verify(s.http)` when constructing `HttpClient`. Do not
invent your own.

## Recipe: add a new setting

1. Pick a section: top-level (rare) or one of the existing sub-models
   (`HttpSettings`, `AwxSettings`, `GithubSettings`, `WorkspaceSettings`).
   New bounded context → add a new sub-model to `untaped_core.settings`
   and wire it into `Settings`.
2. Use the right type:
   - `SecretStr | None = None` for any credential.
   - `Path | None = None` for filesystem paths.
   - `bool` / `int` / `str` with sensible defaults otherwise.
3. **Update tests** in
   `packages/untaped-core/tests/unit/test_settings.py` so the new key is
   loaded from YAML (under `profiles.default`) and overridable via env
   var. Top-level keys are no longer honoured — every value lives under a
   profile.
   - **For `SecretStr` fields:** also bump the expected count and add the
     new path tuple in
     `tests/unit/test_config_schema.py::test_secret_field_paths_matches_known_settings_secrets`.
     That test pins the schema's secret inventory so every credential
     stays reachable for redaction by `untaped profile show`; a missed
     update would silently leak the new credential.
4. **Update tests** in
   `packages/untaped-config/tests/unit/test_list_settings.py` to assert
   the new key shows up in `untaped config list`.
5. If the setting is cross-cutting, update the root `AGENTS.md`'s
   "Cross-Cutting helpers" table or this file's TLS / Profiles sections.
6. Verify with `uv run untaped config list` — the new key appears
   automatically since the schema is walked.
