# AGENTS.md — `untaped`

Single source of truth for how `untaped` core is built. AI agents and
humans both read this file. Plugin internals live in their own repos and
own `AGENTS.md` files. If you change architecture, update the relevant
file in the same commit.

## Mission

`untaped` is a personal DevOps CLI hub. The root package owns plumbing:
the binary, plugin discovery, configuration/profile resolution, output,
stdin, HTTP/TLS, and shared errors. Domain functionality (workspace, awx,
github, profile, …) is delivered by plugins exposing Typer sub-apps
through the `untaped.plugins` entry point group. Daily DevOps work
composes — row-oriented `list`/`get`/`status`-style commands are
pipe-friendly. We build *on top of* existing CLIs (`gh`, `awx-cli`) where
that is the right abstraction.

## Repository Map

The workspace root **is** the `untaped` core package. Domain plugins live
in separate repositories and integrate through entry points.

Plugins live in their own repositories and depend on the public `untaped`
plugin API. Current plugins:

- [`untaped-awx`](https://github.com/alexisbeaulieu97/untaped-awx)
  — the `awx` command for Ansible Automation Platform / AWX workflows.
- [`untaped-ansible`](https://github.com/alexisbeaulieu97/untaped-ansible)
  — the `ansible` command for Ansible dependency graph workflows.
- [`untaped-github`](https://github.com/alexisbeaulieu97/untaped-github)
  — the `github` command for authenticated user and search workflows.
- [`untaped-jira`](https://github.com/alexisbeaulieu97/untaped-jira)
  — the `jira` command for Jira Data Center workflows.
- [`untaped-profile`](https://github.com/alexisbeaulieu97/untaped-profile)
  — the `profile` command for managing the profile inventory.
- [`untaped-themes`](https://github.com/alexisbeaulieu97/untaped-themes)
  — terminal theme presets for semantic UI rendering.
- [`untaped-workspace`](https://github.com/alexisbeaulieu97/untaped-workspace)
  — the `workspace` command for local git workspace manifests and registry state.

## Hard Rules

Non-negotiable. Every contribution must respect them.

1. **Keep all `AGENTS.md` files up to date.** Root for core and
   cross-cutting rules; plugin repos for domain-specific architecture.
   If you change the plugin contract, a DDD layout, or a cross-cutting
   helper, edit the relevant file in the same commit.
2. **Prefer `uv` commands over manual `pyproject.toml` edits.** Use
   `uv add`, `uv add --package <name>`, `uv add --group dev`,
   `uv init --package --lib|--app`. Hand-editing is fine for tool config
   (`[tool.ruff]`, `[tool.mypy]`, …) but never for dependencies.
3. **Register every new plugin through an entry point.** Use
   `[project.entry-points."untaped.plugins"]`; the root must not
   statically import plugin modules.
4. **Use `uv init --package` with `--lib` or `--app` for new plugin
   repos.** Never the bare `uv init` (gives flat layout).
5. **Create shared plumbing only when it is genuinely cross-cutting.**
   Don't duplicate code across plugins. If two plugins need the same
   helper and it is part of the hub contract, it belongs in `src/untaped/`;
   otherwise use a separate shared library.
6. **Search before writing.** Grep `src/untaped` and relevant plugin
   repos before implementing a helper. If it exists in the wrong place,
   *move* it (and update callers); don't fork.
7. **Finish each session with `uv run ruff check --fix && uv run ruff
   format`.** No exceptions.
8. **Write tests that verify the result.** TDD: failing test first, then
   implementation. Test through public APIs — never suppress warnings to
   access private members.
9. **Every Typer app and every command with required args sets
   `no_args_is_help=True`.** No-args invocation must show help, not error.
10. **Every plugin declares port `Protocol`s in `application/ports.py`.**
    Use cases import their ports from there; concrete adapters in
    `infrastructure/` satisfy the Protocols structurally (no
    inheritance). Subsystems within a domain may add their own
    (`untaped-awx` has `application/test/ports.py` for the test runner).
    Use cases declare the **narrowest port they need**; fatter ports
    extend slimmer ones via `Protocol` inheritance so concrete adapters
    satisfy every variant structurally.
11. **Mark every secret as `pydantic.SecretStr`.** Tokens, passwords, API
    keys. `untaped config list` redacts them; `repr(settings)` won't leak
    them in tracebacks. Call `.get_secret_value()` only at point of use.
12. **Use `resolve_verify(settings.http)` for every httpx client.** Never
    hard-code `verify=True/False` or a path.
13. **Use absolute imports.** `from untaped import …`, never
    `from .foo import bar`. Enforced by ruff's
    `ban-relative-imports = "all"`; applies to tests too.

## Architecture: Core + Plugin DDD

`untaped` core is the exception: it is the hub and shared library, not a
domain plugin. Its layout is intentionally mostly flat for plumbing
(`plugins.py`, `settings.py`, `config_file.py`, `http.py`, `output.py`,
…), with built-in `config` under `src/untaped/config/`.

Every plugin package (`untaped-<X>`) has the same internal layout:

```
src/untaped_<x>/
├── __init__.py           # re-exports `app: typer.Typer`
├── cli/                  # Typer commands (thin)
├── application/          # use cases (orchestration)
├── domain/               # entities, value objects (pure, no I/O)
└── infrastructure/       # external adapters (httpx clients, fs, …)
```

**Import direction (enforced):**

```
cli  →  application  →  domain
                 ↓
           infrastructure  →  domain
```

- `domain/` imports nothing from the other three layers — pure.
  Owns transport DTOs that cross the application/infrastructure
  boundary (in `domain/payloads.py`) so adapters need not import from
  application.
- `application/` orchestrates: declares its port `Protocol`s and any
  Callable aliases in `application/ports.py`; use cases take them via
  constructor (DI). Concrete adapters speak the port shapes
  structurally — they don't import from `application/`.
- `infrastructure/` knows about httpx, the filesystem, the config file.
- `cli/` is the thinnest layer: parse Typer args, build a use case
  (passing in concrete adapters), call it, format the result.

A use case in `application/` is unit-testable with a stub satisfying its
`Protocol` — no httpx, no fixtures, no settings file.

## Plugin Contract

Plugins expose one object through the `untaped.plugins` entry point group:

```python
class UntapedPlugin(Protocol):
    id: str
    untaped_api_version: int
    def register(self, registry: PluginRegistry) -> None: ...
```

The plugin object must declare a literal `untaped_api_version = 1`. Do not
import a core constant for this value; future cores use the literal to reject
plugins built for an incompatible plugin API before running registration hooks.
Package dependency bounds still matter for import-time failures, while the
runtime API version catches registration-contract mismatches and reports them
through `untaped plugins doctor`.

Available registry hooks:

- `add_cli(name, app)` adds a root command.
- `add_profile_settings(section, model)` contributes a typed profile
  settings section.
- `add_state_settings(section, model)` contributes top-level app state
  spliced into the effective settings model.
- `add_theme(name, spec)` contributes a named `ThemeSpec` preset for
  terminal rendering. Theme plugins register presets only; core owns the
  renderer and still keeps `json`, `yaml`, and `raw` pipe-friendly.
  `ThemeSpec.color_roles` accepts Rich style strings for `header`,
  `border`, `key`, `value`, `success`, `info`, `warning`, and `error`.
  Core emits those styles only for interactive terminal output; redirected
  output remains plain text.
- `add_skill(spec)` contributes a packaged agent skill directory. Skill
  names must be `untaped` or start with `untaped-`; the source directory
  must contain a valid `SKILL.md`. Core owns `untaped skills list/install`
  and plugins only register static skill assets.
- `add_diagnostic(name, check)` contributes `untaped plugins doctor`
  checks.

There is intentionally no prompt-backend registry hook yet. Core owns prompt
primitives and backs them with `prompt_toolkit`; plugins should call the core
prompt helpers instead of importing `typer.prompt`, `typer.confirm`, or
`prompt_toolkit` directly.

Duplicate plugin ids, CLI command names, profile sections, state sections,
diagnostics, theme names, or skill names fail with `ConfigError`. Built-in
theme and skill names are reserved and cannot be shadowed by plugins.
Plugin load failures are recorded and reported by `untaped plugins doctor`;
they must not break built-in core commands such as `untaped config`.

Plugin install specs are keyed by normalized package/plugin name. Direct
URL convenience input (`git+https://.../untaped-profile.git`) is accepted
only when the name can be inferred from the final path segment, then stored
canonically as `untaped-profile @ git+https://...`. Removal and replacement
must work by that normalized name, including for legacy bare URL state.
`untaped plugins list` is a row-oriented data command and follows the shared
`--format` / `--columns` contract; its first row key is `name` so
implicit `--format raw` is pipe-friendly for `untaped plugins remove`.
Implicit raw output emits only removable recorded packages; loaded-only rows
remain visible in table/json/yaml output or when explicitly selecting columns.
`untaped plugins add` and `untaped plugins remove` accept package specs from
multiple positionals or `--stdin`; when syncing, each command mutates the full
batch first and exact-syncs the managed untaped virtual environment once.
Core and plugins are installed into
`${XDG_DATA_HOME:-~/.local/share}/untaped/venv`, with `~/.local/bin/untaped`
as the user-facing shim. Synced plugin commands require the core install spec
recorded by the managed installer; do not fall back to an implicit core spec.
Keep long-running `uv` resolution/install work outside the config file lock and
serialize managed venv writes with the plugin environment lock. Do not
reintroduce `uv tool install --with` as the plugin lifecycle; plugin
dependencies belong in normal package metadata and `uv pip sync` owns
resolution. Managed sync uses the recorded core/plugin specs as the runtime
source of truth and invokes `uv pip compile --no-sources`, so plugin
repo-local `[tool.uv.sources]` tables remain development metadata only.
Dependencies that exist only in a plugin checkout's `[tool.uv.sources]` table
are not installed by managed sync. For editable multi-plugin development,
record every local plugin checkout that should be installed into the managed
environment.

Profile selection has two distinct CLI meanings. Read-time overrides use
`ProfileOverrideOption` plus `profile_override(...)` and expose `--profile`
on the command that reads settings; the helper restores `UNTAPED_PROFILE`
and clears the `get_settings()` cache after the command body. Config mutation
commands use `--target-profile` when choosing which profile to write to.

The default view is one row per plugin package/name, not separate rows for
"loaded" and "desired" state. A desired package such as `untaped-awx` is
coalesced with a loaded plugin id such as `awx` when the normalized suffix
matches; the row status is `installed`, `recorded`, or `loaded`.

Cross-cutting subsystems with their own internals doc:

- **Configuration, profiles, plugin installs, and TLS** live in `src/untaped/`.
  User-facing reference: [`docs/configuration.md`](docs/configuration.md).
  `untaped config get/set/unset` manages scalar settings. Profile keys resolve
  through the active or requested profile; scalar `ui.*` keys are the deliberate
  exception because they read/write the top-level global `ui:` block.
  Structured app state such as `plugins.*`, `workspace.*`, `ui.symbols`, and
  `ui.color_roles` stays outside `config get/set/unset`.
- **Workspace management** lives in the extracted
  [`untaped-workspace`](https://github.com/alexisbeaulieu97/untaped-workspace)
  plugin. Core plugin install guidance lives in
  [`docs/plugins.md`](docs/plugins.md); command reference lives in the plugin
  repo.
- **AWX resource framework, apply pipeline, jobs/track, test runner** live
  in the extracted
  [`untaped-awx`](https://github.com/alexisbeaulieu97/untaped-awx)
  plugin. Core plugin install guidance lives in
  [`docs/plugins.md`](docs/plugins.md); command reference lives in the plugin
  repo.
- **GitHub authenticated user and search** live in the extracted
  [`untaped-github`](https://github.com/alexisbeaulieu97/untaped-github)
  plugin. Core plugin install guidance lives in
  [`docs/plugins.md`](docs/plugins.md); command reference lives in the plugin
  repo.

## Conventions

- **Module docstrings.** Every source module (`*.py`) opens with a
  module docstring describing what it owns. Re-export stubs (layer
  `__init__.py` files like `cli/__init__.py`,
  `infrastructure/__init__.py`, …) are exempt — they're plumbing,
  with nothing to describe.
- **Re-export the public surface.**
  - **Plugin packages**: `<pkg>/__init__.py` re-exports `app:
    typer.Typer`; `<pkg>/plugin.py` exposes the entry-point object that
    registers the app and config sections. Public adapters live in
    `infrastructure/__init__.py` with explicit `__all__`.
  - **`untaped`**: re-exports its public plugin/core API from
    `src/untaped/__init__.py` with explicit `__all__`.
- **Per-command flags vs shared option types.** Per-command flags in
  `cli/commands.py` use call-site defaults
  (`field: Type = typer.Option(..., "--flag", help="…")`). Shared
  option types reused across commands live in `untaped` as
  `Annotated[…, typer.Option(…)]` aliases (e.g. `FormatOption`,
  `ColumnsOption`).
- **`errors.py` placement.** Domain packages with their own exception
  subclasses keep them in a top-level `errors.py`; `untaped-awx`
  additionally has `infrastructure/errors.py` for HTTP-status →
  exception mapping. Plugins that only raise `untaped` exceptions don't
  need an `errors.py`.
- **Lazy imports on CLI startup paths.** Heavy transitive imports that
  would pay on every `untaped --help` are deferred into subcommand
  bodies and annotated `# noqa: PLC0415`. Scope: any module reached
  on the import graph from `src/untaped/main.py` at startup. Enforced
  by ruff (`extend-select = ["PLC0415"]`); tests are exempted.

## Output & Piping Conventions

- **stdout = data only.** Never print logs, prompts, or progress to
  stdout.
- **stderr = everything else.** Logs, progress, prompts. Use
  `typer.echo(msg, err=True)`.
- **Row-oriented data commands** (`list`, `status`, row-producing `get`,
  …) expose:
  - `--format / -f` (`json | yaml | table | raw`); default `table` for
    `list`, `yaml` for `get`.
  - `--columns / -c` (repeatable). Dotted paths supported
    (`summary_fields.project.name`).
  - `--stdin` to consume newline-separated identifiers when the command
    takes a list.
- **Scalar detail commands** may deliberately omit `--columns` and choose a
  command-specific format default. `untaped config get <key>` defaults to raw
  value output so it can be used directly in shell scripts.
- **Side-effect-only commands** (`use`, `delete`, `rename`,
  `apply --yes`, …) and interactive flows are exempt — no `--format`
  knob.
- **`--format raw` without `--columns`** emits each row's first key.
  Every list use case promises that the first key is the row's
  identifier (workspace name, job id, login, …) so pipelines like
  `untaped workspace list -f raw | xargs -I{} untaped workspace path
  {}` get the right value. Reordering keys in a row source — hand-built
  dict or pydantic model — is a contract break. Details:
  this section's `--format raw` default-column contract.
- **`--all` vs `--all-<axis>`.** Bare `--all` means "iterate every
  instance of the noun the command targets" (`workspace sync --all`,
  `workspace status --all`). When a command iterates a *different*
  axis or changes view shape, use `--all-<axis>` to disambiguate
  (`awx save --all-kinds` for the type axis, `config list
  --all-profiles` for view shape). New commands that grow an `--all`
  flag must cross-check this convention.
- **`--follow --format json` always emits NDJSON.** One bare JSON
  object per line, no enclosing array brackets — so `jq` can ingest
  the stream directly without `jq -s '.[]'`. Today: `awx jobs events
  --follow` and `awx jobs logs --follow`. New `--follow` commands that
  emit structured data under `--format json` must match this shape.
  yaml/raw/table under `--follow` is per-line single-doc emission;
  yaml has no canonical streaming form.

Pipeline examples and the morning-routine workflow live in
[`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md#pipe-friendly-by-design).

## Development Workflow

```bash
uv sync                                         # install / sync core
uv run pre-commit install                       # local lint at commit + mypy at push
uv add --group dev some-test-helper             # dev dep on the root
uv run pytest                                   # tests with coverage (gate: 80%)
uv run ruff check --fix && uv run ruff format   # lint + format
uv run mypy                                     # strict types
uv run untaped --help                           # run the CLI from source
scripts/install.sh --editable .                 # install the managed `untaped` shim
```

User-facing config, profile resolution, and the optional profile plugin
workflow are documented in [`docs/configuration.md`](docs/configuration.md).

**Coverage measurement.** `--cov` is in `addopts`, so every `pytest`
invocation measures coverage by default (gate: 80%). Two non-obvious
behaviours worth knowing:

- `pytest --collect-only` reports ~31% coverage. The cov-plugin runs
  against import-time only when collection is the only step — it's not
  a regression in real coverage. Run `pytest` (without `--collect-only`)
  for the real number.
- For tight TDD loops, `pytest --no-cov` skips coverage measurement
  and shaves a few hundred milliseconds per run.

**TDD loop:**
1. Write the failing test (`tests/unit/` for core; plugin repos use
   their own `tests/unit/`).
2. Run it; confirm it fails for the right reason.
3. Implement the smallest change that makes it pass.
4. Refactor with the test still green.

**Test layout:**
- Core tests live in `tests/unit/`. Plugin tests live in each plugin
  repo. Use `tests/integration/` when the test exercises a real
  subprocess or fake-server fixture.
- No `__init__.py` files inside `tests/` — pytest uses
  `--import-mode=importlib`.
- Mock httpx with `respx` (already a dev dep).
- For CLI tests, use `typer.testing.CliRunner`.

## Decision Tree: Where does this code go?

1. **Shared across two or more plugins?** → `src/untaped/` if it is hub
   plumbing, or a separate shared lib if it is a coherent subdomain.
2. **CLI-only (argument parsing, output formatting)?** → `cli/` inside
   the domain.
3. **Pure business logic — entities, value objects, invariants?** →
   `domain/`.
4. **Talks to an external service (HTTP, fs, subprocess)?** →
   `infrastructure/`.
5. **Orchestrates steps between domain and infrastructure?** →
   `application/`.

## Recipe: Add a new plugin repo

```bash
# 1. Create the plugin repo/package
uv init --package --lib untaped-<X>
# 2. Add deps
uv add typer untaped
# 3. Build the 4 layers
mkdir -p src/untaped_<x>/{cli,application,domain,infrastructure}
mkdir -p tests/unit
```

Then:
- Implement `domain/models.py`, `infrastructure/<x>_client.py`,
  `application/<use_case>.py`, `cli/commands.py`. Add `@app.callback()`
  (single-command Typer apps collapse without it).
- Re-export `app` from `cli/__init__.py` and the package `__init__.py`.
- Add `plugin.py` and register the Typer app/config sections:
  ```python
  from untaped.plugins import PluginRegistry
  from untaped_<x> import app

  class XPlugin:
      id = "<x>"
      untaped_api_version = 1

      def register(self, registry: PluginRegistry) -> None:
          registry.add_cli("<x>", app)

  plugin = XPlugin()
  ```
- Add the entry point to the package `pyproject.toml`:
  ```toml
  [project.entry-points."untaped.plugins"]
  <x> = "untaped_<x>.plugin:plugin"
  ```
- Add a package-local `AGENTS.md` for domain-specific internals
  (resource framework, side-effect adapters, polling cadence, …) plus a
  short `CLAUDE.md` stub pointing back to that file and the core repo.
- Add plugin docs with the package-specific install spec and command usage.
  Link to `untaped` core's `docs/plugins.md` for generic direct install,
  managed state, editable source, and multi-plugin sync workflows; do not
  duplicate those full flows in every plugin repo.
- Run `uv sync && uv run pytest && uv run untaped <x> --help`.

## Recipe: Add a new command to an existing plugin

1. **Test first** in the plugin repo's `tests/unit/test_<feature>.py`.
2. New external call → add a method to the existing
   `infrastructure/<x>_client.py`. Don't create a new client class
   unless it's a different service.
3. New domain logic → add an entity/method in `domain/`, a use case in
   `application/`.
4. Add the Typer command in `cli/commands.py`:
   - decorate with `@app.command(..., no_args_is_help=True)` if it has
     required args
   - log to stderr; print only data to stdout
   - if it emits data: accept `--format` and `--columns`; support
     `--stdin` if it takes a list
   - pure side-effect commands and interactive flows can skip the
     pipe-friendly knobs
5. Run tests, lint, format. Verify:
   `uv run untaped <X> <new-command> --help`.

## Recipe: Add a new setting

Core settings (`log_level`, `http`) live in `src/untaped/settings.py`.
Plugin settings live with the plugin and are registered from
`plugin.py` with `add_profile_settings` and/or `add_state_settings`.
Credentials must be `SecretStr`; HTTP clients must still consume
`resolve_verify(get_core_settings().http)`.

## Common Mistakes

- **Importing httpx, pyyaml, or os in a `domain/` module.** Domain is
  pure. Move the call to `infrastructure/`.
- **A `cli/` module calling business logic from `infrastructure/`
  instead of going through an `application/` use case.** Wiring concrete
  adapters at the composition root (e.g. `cli/_context.py`) is fine; the
  ban is on bypassing application use cases for the actual logic.
- **Adding a new dep with `pyproject.toml` edits.** Use `uv add` in the
  repo that owns the dependency.
- **Writing a helper inside a plugin that another plugin will need.**
  Move it to `src/untaped/` only if it is hub plumbing; otherwise use a
  separate shared lib (move ≠ copy).
- **Forgetting the plugin entry point.** Test: does
  `uv run untaped --help` list the plugin command after the package is
  installed in the environment?
- **Adding a single-command Typer app without `@app.callback()`.** Typer
  collapses single-command apps into a flat command, breaking subcommand
  dispatch from the root CLI.
- **Adding a new setting without thinking about secrets and TLS.**
  Credentials → `pydantic.SecretStr`. Hostnames for TLS services → the
  client must use `resolve_verify(get_core_settings().http)`.
- **Forgetting `no_args_is_help=True` on commands with required args.**
- **Naming a method `list` on a class whose annotations elsewhere include
  `list[X]`.** mypy resolves `list` to the method, not the builtin. Use
  `entries` instead, or `Iterator[X]` / `Iterable[X]` returns (no
  collision).
- **Changing workspace git semantics in core.** Workspace git operations
  live in the extracted `untaped-workspace` plugin; update that repo's
  `AGENTS.md` and tests with any workspace behavior change.
